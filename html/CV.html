	<h2>Gala Game Studio</h2>

	Initiator: Euan Shih</p>
	
	<p class="categorylabel">Introduction of Gala</p>
	<p>Today is February 17, 2014. From now on , we are ‘Gala’, which is named after a band of China, whose music is extremely peerless!They bring me too much mirth.</p>
	<p>Gala ,as one of the word in Chinese dialects, is often used in many northern and southern areas . It refers to the corner of a room or a yard. According to “Modern Chinese Dictionary”, It has the meaning of “remote and narrow place” ,which just like what I wanna do.</p>
	<p>We named after “Gala” not only because we want to be reliable , but also to be humour when we are lucky to communicate with you all in this PAGE. We hope to create unique and excellent product. At the same time , we wish we are aware that we are just the “Gala” of the whole world, doing what we like and keeping going for a better tomorrow!</p>
	<p class="categorylabel">The desire to be successful can not assure you success,but sticking to persevering with the ambition to be excellent always makes you successful!</p>
